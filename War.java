* War - A class that represents the card game war where two players split a deck of cards.
* Then with both players having a their stack of cards face down pull their top card and play
* it face up. This is a battle and the player with the higher card takes both cards played and
* adds them to the bottom of their deck. If the players battle and their cards are of equal 
* value then there is a war, which each player takes the top card of their deck and places it
* face down and then plays the next top card face up. Which ever player wins this battle takes
* the 6 cards previously played and adds them to the bottom of their deck. If during a war the 
* cards played face up are of equal value you follow the same protocal and war again until their
* is a defined winner. If a player runs out of cards in his deck he immediatly loses.
